in this challenge, the redirect url needs to start with /. the developer made the assumption that only a path/uri can start with /. however, it's possible to bypass this mechanism by using //. for this challenge, you may want to use another site than webhook.site as they don't automatically redirect http:// to https://. otherwise, you can use the https:// url for this exercise.
