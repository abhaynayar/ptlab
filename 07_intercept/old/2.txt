Introduction
This course details how to perform a Person-in-the-Middle attack against a client performing an HTTP connection over TLS. Knowing how to perform this type of attacks is critical when performing mobile applications and thick clients testing.

The exercise
Like with the first exercise, you have control over the client's DNS resolution. Using this you will be able to lie and tell the client to go to your server instead of the legitimate one. If you manage to get access to the request's content, you finished this exercise.

This exercise is divided in two steps:

Setting up a DNS server like you did in the first exercise of this badge.
Setting up a TCP server with TLS support.
This is an introduction to more complex exercises that will go into details on how to intercept TLS connection.

Setting up a DNS server
For this part, you can just follow the steps highlighted in the first exercise on MITM. The only thing that changed is the hostname used by the client.

A simple TCP server with TLS support
To create a simple TCP server with TLS support we need to create a certificate. This can easily be done using OpenSSL. It's worth automating this as you may do this often during a security assessment.

I personally use a script that creates everything I need:

$ cat create_cert.sh
FILENAME=server
# Generate a public/private key pair:
openssl genrsa -out $FILENAME.key 1024
# Generate a self signed certificate:
openssl req -new -key $FILENAME.key -x509 -sha256 -days 3653 -out $FILENAME.crt
# Generate the PEM file by just appending the key and certificate files:
cat $FILENAME.key $FILENAME.crt >$FILENAME.pem

Once you run all these commands, you can run your own server with TLS support using socat:

$ sudo socat -v -v openssl-listen:443,reuseaddr,fork,cert=$FILENAME.pem,cafile=$FILENAME.crt,verify=0 -

If you get the request from the client, it shows that the client does not perform any kind of certificate validation.

The command above will give us the content of the request, but you often want to just listen to the request and forward it to the legitimate server. This can be done using the following command:

$ sudo socat -v -v openssl-listen:443,reuseaddr,fork,cert=$FILENAME.pem,cafile=$FILENAME.crt,verify=0  openssl-connect:[SERVER]:[PORT],verify=0
